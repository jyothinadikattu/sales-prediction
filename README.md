# sales-prediction
Description:
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising budgets using linear regression. The dataset contains expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads and the corresponding sales figures. The primary objective is to analyze how different media investments influence sales performance. After importing and visualizing the data, we perform data cleaning and normalization to prepare for modeling. We use scikit-learn’s LinearRegression to train a model using TV advertising as the main feature. The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score, which was approximately 0.80, indicating a good fit. A scatter plot is used to visually compare the actual vs. predicted sales. The red regression line shows the predicted trend while blue dots represent actual data points. This analysis highlights that TV advertising has a strong linear relationship with sales. The model can help businesses optimize marketing budgets for better ROI.
